            The Allen Brain Observatory presents the first standardized 
            in vivo surveys of physiological activity in the mouse visual 
            cortex. Neural activity is recorded using two different modalities: 
            2-photon optical physiology and Neuropixels probes.  
            We make all the data from our systematic surveys of the mouse visual
            system available to the community for further analysis and 
            exploration. These data provide a rich testbed for theories and models 
            of cortical computation.

        <h1> The Allen Brain Observatory Ecosystem on Github </h1>
        
        <p> 
            The Allen Brain observatory encompasses two broad projects: 
            Visual Coding and Visual Behavior. <b>Visual Coding</b> uses a broad
             range of visual stimuli, ranging from gratings and noise stimuli 
             to natural images and movies which the mice passively view. 
             It surveys the spatial and temporal dynamics of visual representation 
             in the mouse corticothalamic visual pathways. 
             
             In the <b>Visual Behavior</b> project, mice perform a visual
              change detection task to characterize how sensation and 
              behavior are encoded in activity across the visual cortex 
              and how these representations are influenced by behavior state and expectation. 
              Both the Visual Behavior and Visual Coding projects include 
              2-photon and Neuropixels datasets that have slightly different implementations.
        </p>
        <p>
           To accommodate the different neural recording modalities as
            well as the differences between Visual Coding and Visual Behavior, 
            we have created several different Github repositories to facilitate 
            data exploration and analysis across these different data variations.

        <h2> Allen SDK </h2>

        <p>
          The Allen Institute for Brain Science has published the <a href="http://alleninstitute.github.io/AllenSDK">Allen Software Development Kit (SDK)</a>, 
          which houses source code for reading and processing Allen Brain Atlas data.  
          The Allen SDK focuses primarily on tools and analysis associated with the Allen Cell Types Database, Mouse Connectivity 
	  Atlas, and Allen Brain Observatory. 
        </p>

        <h2> Allen Brain Atlas API </h2>

        <p> 
          The Allen Institute for Brain Science offers access to its published data through an 
	  <a href="http://api.brain-map.org/">application programming interface (API)</a>. The API, documentation, and sample applications
	  are made available to the community under the Allen Institute's <a href="http://alleninstitute.org/terms-of-use/">Terms of Use</a>. 
	  The <a href="http://alleninstitute.github.io/AllenSDK">Allen SDK</a> provides Python classes, notebooks, and code samples to facilitate API use.
        </p>
	
	<h2> Research & Publications </h2>
	  
	<p>		
	  Scientists and engineers at the Allen Institute for Brain Science sometimes develop software tools and analysis 
	  platforms for projects that are not available via <a href="http://www.brain-map.org">http://www.brain-map.org</a>.  
	  Code is made available through GitHub for prototyping, user feedback or as supplementary files associated with 
	  research publication.  The projects available on GitHub include the 
	  <a href="https://github.com/AllenInstitute/nwb-api">NWB API</a>, an early prototype Python library 
	  developed as part of the <a href="http://nwb.org/nwb-neurophysiology/">Neurodata Without Borders: Neurophysiology (NWB)</a>
	  project. Code developed for <a href="https://github.com/AllenInstitute/GLIF_Teeter_et_al_2018">Generalized Leaky Integrate and 
	  Fire (GLIF)</a> and <a href="https://github.com/AllenInstitute/biophys_optimize">biophysical</a> models derived from data 
	  in the <a href="http://celltypes.brain-map.org">Allen Cell Types Database</a> is also available.
	</p>
        
	<h2> Brain Modeling Toolkit (BMTK) </h2>
	  
	<p>
	   The <a href="https://alleninstitute.github.io/bmtk/">Brain Modeling Toolkit (BMTK)</a> is a python-based software package 
	   for creating and simulating large-scale neural network models. It supports building, simulation and analysis of models at 
           different levels of resolution including biophysically detailed networks, point neuron networks, filter models, and 
           population-level networks.
	</p>

        <h2> DiPDE </h2>
        
        <p>
          <a href='http://alleninstitute.github.io/dipde'>DiPDE (dipde)</a> is a simulation platform for numerically solving the time
	  evolution of coupled networks of neuronal populations. Instead of solving the subthreshold dynamics of individual model
	  leaky-integrate-and-fire (LIF) neurons, dipde models the voltage distribution of a population of neurons with a single 
	  population density equation. In this way, dipde can facilitate the fast exploration of mesoscale (population-level) network
	  topologies, where large populations of neurons are treated as homogeneous with random fine-scale connectivity.
